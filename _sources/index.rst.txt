   Weekly material
   ---------------

   The numerical analysis and implementation parts of the module run in
   parallel. Each part has videos and exercises embedded in its notes.

   A PDF version of the course notes is `available here
   <Finiteelementcourse.pdf>`_.

   Part 1: Numerical analysis
   --------------------------
   
   The material is presented by means of a set of lecture notes, with lecture
   videos interspersed in the notes. 

   The text for this part of the module is Brenner and Scott *The
   Mathematical Theory of Finite Element Methods*. The University of Luxembourg has
   paid for PDF access to this book, so it is accessible from
   the University of Luxembourg network at `Springer Link
   <http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-0-387-75934-0>`__.

   However, this course has the material rearranged to synchronise the
   content better between the lecture notes and the implementation
   exercise.

    Part 2: Implementation
    ----------------------

    The implementation part of the module aims to give the students a
    deeper understanding of the finite element method through writing
    software to solve finite element problems in one and two dimensions.

    The key to this part of the
    module is to build up a working finite element implementation over the course
    of the term, and thereby to gain a practical understanding of the method.

    The starting point for the implementation method is the skeleton code, an
    outline of a simple finite element library written in Python. Many of the
    critical algorithms in the skeleton code are left unimplemented, it will be
    your task to implement them over the course of the term.

    Each chapter of the implementation describes how a part of the finite element
    method is implemented. Along the way are videos which explain the text, or
    walk through the algorithms presented. Also interspersed in the text are
    exercises, typically requiring you to implement the algorithm just
    presented. We will look at how to do this in more detail presently.
